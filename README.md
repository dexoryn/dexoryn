Rust Engineer& Web 3 Developer toAI

Hi there 👋,This is Dexoryn,  I’m a Rust Engineer & Web3 Developer passionate about AI-powered innovations.

🌱 Open to collaborations on experimental projects bridging AI and Web3 — from autonomous agents to real-time data economies.
I believe the future of blockchain lies in intelligent, adaptive infrastructure that learns and evolves with its users.

💎 Currently diving into X402 micropayments — building instant, verifiable on-chain payment solutions for streaming and content platforms.

I love creating secure, scalable, and cutting-edge applications in Rust and Web3, and sharing my experiments with the community.

🚀 Always exploring, learning, and pushing the boundaries of blockchain and AI.
