👋 Hey there, I’m Dexoryn

I’m a Rust Engineer & Web3 Developer passionate about AI-powered innovations.

💎 Currently diving into X402 micropayments — building instant, verifiable on-chain payment solutions for streaming and content platforms.

I love creating secure, scalable, and cutting-edge applications in Rust and Web3, and sharing my experiments with the community.

🦀 Focused on building AI-integrated decentralized systems that redefine how we interact with data, payments, and trust.
🚀 Always exploring, learning, and pushing the boundaries of blockchain intelligence.

🌱 Open to collaborations on projects that merge AI + Web3 — from autonomous networks to adaptive smart contracts.
